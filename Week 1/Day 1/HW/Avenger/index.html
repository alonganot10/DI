						<p style="font-family: ariel" class="para">89P13 is a genetically enhanced creature turned freelance criminal, calling himself Rocket. Alongside his friend and partner Groot, Rocket traveled the galaxy picking up bounties until they met Star-Lord who then convinced them to assist him to sell the Orb for a massive profit. However, as it was discovered that the Orb was one of the Infinity Stones which was being sought out by Ronan the Accuser, Rocket was convinced to risk everything to stop Ronan's plans to destroy Xandar and enslave the world. During the ensuing conflict, Rocket managed to assist his friends in destroying Ronan, despite Groot being killed. Rocket then became a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy alongside the newly planted baby Groot.</p>
